This website relies heavily on *Ruby*, and, in turn, *Jekyll* due to the extensive usage of Markdown files. My goal here is to see what it would look like to have a primarily-Markdown website of pages representing the up-to-date versions of documentation, and the associated github repo representing the change-log. To this end, it might be helpful to have each subsection of docs to be segregated in order for commits to be as discriminatory as possible.
