This website relies heavily on *Ruby*, and, in turn, *Jekyll* due to the extensive usage of Markdown files. My goal here is to see what it would look like to have a primarily-Markdown website of pages representing the up-to-date versions of documentation, and the associated github repo representing the change-log. To this end, it might be helpful to have each subsection of docs to be segregated in order for commits to be as discriminatory as possible.
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
